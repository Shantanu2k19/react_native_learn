##Notes 
**_layout.tsx (underscore prefix)**
Special filename in Expo Router

Acts as a default layout wrapper for all sibling and nested routes in the same folder.

Every screen in that folder will be rendered inside whatever <Slot /> you put in _layout.tsx.



**layout.tsx (no underscore)**
Just a normal component file named layout.tsx.

Not automatically recognized as a special wrapper by Expo Router.

It only works as a layout if you explicitly import and use it in your screens.

<Tabs> #create a bottom bar 

<Tabs.Screen> #Represents one tab/page in your app.


() # files nside parenthesis are routes

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
